Gemma 2 / Gemma 3 Paradigm-Driven LoRA Fine-Tuning Utility.

This script provides fine-tuning pipelines for Gemma models (2B, 9B, 27B)
using Unsloth (for up to 4x speedup and 80% VRAM savings) with automated
fallback to Hugging Face PEFT + TRL.

Key Paradigms Supported:
  1. clinical_cot    : Skeptical differential diagnosis with Popperian H0 testing & Cochrane RoB 2 tiers.
  2. fhir_extraction : Strict FHIR R4 Bundle JSON extraction from clinical intake notes.
  3. patient_tutor   : Socratic patient education dialogues.

Usage Examples:
  # Dry-run test dataset formatting
  python scripts/finetune_gemma_lora.py --paradigm clinical_cot --dry_run

  # Fine-tune Gemma 2 9B model
  python scripts/finetune_gemma_lora.py --model_name unsloth/gemma-2-9b-it --paradigm fhir_extraction --output_dir ./lora_fhir

  # Export to GGUF format for edge deployment (requires Unsloth)
  python scripts/finetune_gemma_lora.py --export_gguf q4_k_m
